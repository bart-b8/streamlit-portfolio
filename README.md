# My Personal Portfolio Page
This is a web app to showcase the projects I build
myself or highlight my contributions to other projects.

It will only show the 8 most recent developements in my 
journey to become a programmer. I will change older, less 
relevant projects, with newer ones. To show what I'm 
currently working on.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page.
